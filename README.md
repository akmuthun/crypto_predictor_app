<h1> Crypto Currency Price Predictor</h1>

<p>This is my first Machine Learning Web Application. My purpose was learning Flask and merge it with Machine Learning. This application will predict crypto prices for next 5-days and plot it in a graph. The backend is supported with a pre designed MLP Neural Network-Tensorflow (3- hiddden levels). For more information about the structure, follow my repositories  <a href="https://github.com/akmuthun/Time-Series-Neural-Network-Grid-Search">Time-Series-Neural-Network-Grid-Search </a> and <a href="https://github.com/akmuthun/stock_market_predictions_neural_net">stock_market_predictions_neural_net. </a> </p> 
<p> The performance can be optimized by changing the network structure or by changing to LSTM or RNN network as discussed in the repositories above. </p>
